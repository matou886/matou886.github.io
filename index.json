I use R language to build up a new CP algorithm and combining it with Polynomial Regression and Neural Networks. All algorithms (including Adam and rmsprop optimizer) are built from the bottom without using any library. In the later stage, to speed up the training process, pytorch is used. R, Python, PyTorch\n  Heat Capacity Fitting\nThe aim of the project is to obtain a more reliable chemical model for predicting the specific heat capacity of organic matter at different temperatures, and gradient descent (based on PyTorch) as well as Bayesian parameter estimation (based on Pymc3 package) are used. As the only student majored in Computer Science, I almost did all the coding, including data cleaning, model optimization, and model verification. Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pymc3, PyTorch\n  Multimodal Emotion Recognition\nThis project is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, and the project code is 61672202. In this Project, Multimodal data (i.e. face recording, speech data, skin conductivity) are used to analyze human emotional state, and the technologies involved are deep learning, face recognition and speech recognition. PyTorch and Yolov5 are used throughout the project. I cooperate with Dr. Shipiao. She is responsible for finding useful papers and providing ideas, while I’m responsible for all the coding and implementation. Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Yolov5\n  Application of multimodal deep learning model in Internet of vehicles\nWe use Keras and Tensorflow to build a deep learning model that can use the driver’s facial recording to predict the speed, heartbeat and other data. In order to solve the privacy and security problem of driver’s information, I built a differential privacy framework with Python to protect the whole database. Python, Keras, Tensorflow\n  OTHER HIGHLIGHTS  Served as the leader of the reception team in Ningbo International Education Week, successfully received international students from other schools, director of Ningbo Education Bureau and director of Ningbo Foreign Affairs Office. Was nominated by superviser to be excellent researcher in the summer research project (FURP), and be invited to share research experience on the FOSE official account. Won the third place in the school badminton men’s singles competition.  "

	"content": "Machine Learning Development Checklist Software Requirements This project requires the development and delivery of a user‑friendly application that implements a machine learning development checklist that will assist practitioners and academics implement high‑quality and validated machine learning systems.\nBackground In many professions there are clear steps to achieve successful results. We know what needs to be done to complete tasks correctly. However, in all professions, errors still occur. A large source of these errors is due to professionals forgetting, overlooking or under‑estimating standard procedures. It has been proposed that adopting a checklist procedure is an excellent way to avoid these errors. In his book Checklist Manifesto, surgeon Atul Gawande argues about how checklists can be used in many professions. With a special focus on the medical profession, he shows how using checklists can save lives by addressing human fallibility and avoiding simple errors. In machine learning development there are also standard steps required to get a machine learning system working correctly and to ensure it is validated correctly. Development methodologies such as CRISP‑DM have been around for a long time and several authors have proposed systematic approaches to machine learning development. However, these steps are routinely ignored, overlooked or implemented incorrectly. There is room for development of checklist software that will aid academics and professionals in developing good quality machine learning software.\nOutline This project aims to develop a software package to implement a checklist for use as part of machine learning development. Although a checklist could be a simple set of actions that need to be ticked off one by one, in this project more complex actions will need to be expressed in the software:‑\n(1) Branches when different checklist actions are required for different types of problem; e.g. the\ndifference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning will require some different validation actions.\n(2) Measurements will need to be entered into the system, related to the machine learning algorithm performance.\n(3) Some actions further along the list may be dependent on responses at previous steps\n(e.g. matching measured performance against objectives). Prof. Dave Towey School of Computer Science 10GRP Project Catalogue 2021‑2022 14th September 2021\n(4) Customizable options will need to be accepted to allow for special requirements for different machine learning applications.\n(5) Generation of a validation certificate at the final completion stage. The development of machine learning checklist software will greatly help practitioners and academics working in this area.\nTasks \u0026amp; Deliverables This is a software development task, not a machine learning research project!\nFor background information, please see:‑\n  Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande\n  Data Science for Business by Tom Fawcett and Foster Provost (2013)\n  How to avoid machine learning pitfalls: a guide for academic researchers (2021), Michael A.Lones; arxiv.org/abs/2108.02497\n  Validate AI; validateai.org\n   "
